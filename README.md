# Charles Darwin: A Journey that Shaped Evolutionary Biology
In this website, there is a rich timeline of Charles Darwin's history. The site centres around how Darwin became one of the greatest scientists to influence the thought of evolution throughout the past 200 years. It is a focus on the man himself and shines a spotlight on the most pinnacle parts of his life that lead to his incredible theory of evolution. 
The site is targeted towards people of all ages, who have taken a particular interest in biology and it's history, whether that be for studying purposes or simply to educate themselves later in life. 
This site will be useful for people looking to find out about the key stages of his life in specific regards to his work as a naturalist. It will also be useful to those wanting to understand the origins of the theory of evolution and the process that Darwin went through to become a successful theorist and publisher.

## Features

Navigation Bar
  - The fully responsive navigation bar provides links for each page of the website and is located on every page. The nav bar is accessible to the user throughout each web page as they scroll down.

  - This paragraph provides information on the places he visited while on his voyage, as well as higlighting key discoveries on his travels.
     - These are vital pieces of information because they link Charles Darwin as a ordinary man, to the success he had with his theory of evolution. It highlights the two main targets of the website coming together.
  - There is an image of the route the HMS Beagle took during the time it was sailing.

### Second Page 

Darwin's life after the HMS Beagle
  - This paragraph focuses on how Darwin used his findings once back in England and also how he advanced in his career.
     - This information is vital to the user as it recognises the start of his career as a biologist and how that impacted his later accomplishments.

Darwin's Finches
  - This sub-section provides a youtube video of Darwin's finches. Descirbing the differences between the specimens Darwin found and the impact that had on his theories.
     - The youtube video is a brillaint additon to the website as it provides another form of learning for the user and breaks up the large chunks of text.

Darwin's First Book
  - This paragraph describes the process Darwin went throught to get his first book published. (The Origin of Species by means of Natural Selection).
     - This is quite possibly the most important part of the site becasue this part of Darwin's life is what changed the historical thought of evolution forever. It provides the user with very relevant information in regards to the purpose of the site.

Links to Other Sites 
  - This section provides a brief description of other information the users might like to pursue as well as providing links. The information is relation to the wesbite's content.
     - This will help the user go further in the research if they so wish, without enforcing all of that extra information on them in this site.

### Third Page

Further Research Suggestions
  - This section provides the names of other important figures in the history of evolutionary thought.
    - This allows the user to explore beyond the life of Charles Darwin and branch off further into the history of biology.
  
Newsletter
  - There is a chance for users to sign up to the 'Everyday Evolution' Newsletter if they so wish.The form allows users to enter data into the fields and submit the form.
   - This adds an extra layer of user intercativity to the website.

Footer
   - The footer contains a Copyright note. As this is a historical website and not a wesbite encourgaing the use of a product, I have not included social media links.

##Features to Implement 
  -  It would be a good idea to include another page where users can have a brief introduction to what the Newsletter looks like as well as the information on there.
  -  Background image would make the site look more professional

Testing
 - While I have run rigarous testing through my vscode I have not been able to access the Valdiator Testing sites provided by Code Institute. The sites do not accept my url.
 - Here is my deployed site: https://laurenforster25.github.io/charles-darwin-project-one/

Fixing Bugs
  -The first bug I fixed was connecting my CSS in the HTML file. I had not included the entire file path to the style.css folder and that had prevented my file from connecting.
  -The next vital bug that occured in my code was when I used the video element. I could not get the code to work and I came to the conlusion that youtube itself would not load in the browser. In the end I used an iframe to embed the video into the document which now works.

##Credits

All of the code used in this project is my own apart from this iframe snippet:   <iframe width="500" height="300"

    frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"

</iframe>

-While i have been mostly absent these past few months due to a personal loss. I would like to thank my cohort leader for helping me when I needed it. On my next project I will be sure to use all of the resources available to me and improve my coding skills.
